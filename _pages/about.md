I am a PhD student in Computer Science at RPI, where I work on machine learning and time series forecasting on cardiological data.

My research focuses on learning robust and interpretable models for complex real-world data, with particular emphasis on time series and multimodal representations. I am especially interested in settings where automated models must reason over heterogeneous inputs and align with domain-driven structure and constraints.

This site documents my research and teaching activities. Publications and supporting materials will be added as they become available.
