I am a PhD student in Computer Science at **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute**, where I work on machine learning and data mining.

My research focuses on learning robust and interpretable models for complex real-world data, with particular emphasis on time series and multimodal representations. I am especially interested in settings where automated models must reason over heterogeneous inputs and align with domain-driven structure and constraints.

I am currently developing methods for representation learning and model fusion, with applications to large-scale and high-dimensional data. My broader interests include interpretability, generalization under distribution shift, and building systems that bridge methodological advances with practical deployment.

This site documents my research and teaching activities. Publications and supporting materials will be added as they become available.
